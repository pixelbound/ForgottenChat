<p align="justify">Since ForgottenChat is the undertaking of a single university student, there is obviously going to be errors in the system. In addition, The World of Warcraft UI environment while incredibly entertaining is not the most stable known to programming-kind. Below is a list of known bugs within ForgottenChat and conflicts with other mods. I have also included how to report bugs and bring them to the attention of the <a href="AboutFCDevTeam.html">Dev Team</a>. </p>
<p class="style5">Known Bugs In The Latest Version:</p>
<ul><li>Linking does not work from the tradeskill frames </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style5">Known Conflicts With Other UI Mods. </span></p>
<ul>
  <li>BugSak</li>
  <li>ChatBox</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style5">Reporting a Bug to the Dev Team: </span></p>
<p align="justify">When ForgottenChat crashes, causes WoW to crash, or you receive an error message associated with ForgottenChat, it is greatly appreciated that you take the time to report such a crash to the Development Team so they can fix it for everyone else. While you CAN simply tell us that ForgottenChat is broken, it is exponentially easier to fix the problem if we know more details.</p>
<p align="justify">Knowing what the error message says is a good start. Knowing a line number, file name, and what the issue is helps us isolate the problem. We need to know what version you are running. Maybe the latest version fixed the bug! </p>
<p align="justify">In addition, it is nice to know if it is a problem you get on a regular basis, or if it is an isolated instance. Sometimes errors happen in WoW that are very random and cannot be taken into consideration all the time.</p>
<p align="justify">Devs also need to know if it is a conflict with another UI mod that you have installed on your system so they can test it under appropriate circumstances. If the Dev Team does not know what Mod is causing the conflict, and cannot replicate the error then ForgottenChat will be &quot;Working As Intended&quot;. To test if it is a compatability issue, simply disable all addons other than ForgottenChat and log back in. If it WORKS with other mods disabled, then it is a conflict, and further experiments must be done to determine which conflict it is.</p>
<p align="justify">Now that you know what the Devs need to know, you can communicate via the following mediums. Be forewarned that if you try to contact me in game, I will only give you my full and undivided attention if I am NOT busy.</p>
