Before a whisper is sent to it's appropriate widget, it is scanned by all the entries in the blacklist. If the whisper starts with any of the blacklisted phrases, it is ignored by ForgottenChat. This feature was included to bypass automated whispers from other UI mods in the World of Warcraft. Most of them start with a recognizable phrase. This is not all inclusive, but provides a modicum of protection.<br />
