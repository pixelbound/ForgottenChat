  <p align="justify">Whisper logging is a feature built into ForgottenChat which keeps a record of all incoming and outgoing whispers with your current character. By default, only whispers from the current session are recorded, and will be dumped the next time you log in. By enabling the <a href="AboutFCSettings.html">Save History</a> setting, all whispers recorded will be saved as long as desired. If the setting <a href="AboutFCSettings.html">Selective Widgets</a> is enabled, only whispers that pass through a widget will be recorded.</p>
  <p align="justify">To view the history while in game, use the '/fc log' command to bring up the history panel. By default this shows all the whispers sent and received since you last logged in. On the History List is a complete list of names with which you have recorded conversations. Selecting a name will show the full history for that character. Only whispers coming to, and going from the character you are currently logged in as will be displayed. To see histories from your alt, you must be logged in as them. </p>
  <p align="justify">When searching the recorded whispers, the search will automatically search all recipients for a matching phrase, and when a whisper is found and highlight them in red. To search a specific recipients history, select the name from the list while a search pattern has been defined. If the name on the History List is red, that recipient has a whisper matching the current search pattern.</p>
