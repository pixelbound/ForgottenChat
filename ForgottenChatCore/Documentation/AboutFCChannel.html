<p align="justify">Unlike the ForgottenChat <a href="AboutFCWhisper.html" target="_self">Whisper System</a>, the ForgottenChat Channel Support works a little bit differantly. With whispers, you can have anywhere between (and including) 0 to 12 widgets open at any time and you can close one and free it up for later use. With the Channel Support, there are 7 widgets - none of which can be CLOSED. Each Channel Widget (numbered 1-7) will simply mirror what is said in the Default WoW ChatFrames (also numbered 1 through to 7... see the pattern?). </p>
<p align="justify">Channel Support was created to make a few things easier. Primary among them is the ability to temporarily hide /1 (*cough*barrens*cough*), Guild, Loot etc. Why waste valuble real estate on /1 when in an instance? Do you really need to see what is going on in guild too?</p>
<p align="justify">By diverting such channels to un-used default World of Warcraft frames and enabling ForgottenChat Channels for them, you can move, minimize, and resize them as you see fit. A basic knowledge of the World of Warcraft Chat System would be handy to fully use this feature. </p>
