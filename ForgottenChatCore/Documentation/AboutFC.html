<p align="justify">Forgotten Chat was conceived, designed and implemented with 1 purpose. To provide an MSN-like environment within the World of Warcraft and replace its overly clunky method of one frame catching every single incoming whisper. With ForgottenChat, each individual incoming whisper is sent to its own portable frame or 'widget' depending on the person who sent it. Up to 12 widgets can be in use at any given time (12 conversations with 12 differant people) and they can all be minimized, moved, and closed independantly of each other.</p>
<p align="justify">Being able to easily distinguish between multiple conversations will make live auctioning, trading, chatting, and dare I say... Gossip easier to organize. Hopefully in the process, World of Warcraft in game communication will become more fluid for everyones personal use. </p>
<p align="justify">All the widgets are highly customizable both in appearance and behavior in an attempt to make ForgottenChat feel more personal and unique. See the <a href="www.testing.com">Settings</a> page for details of how to customize your widgets.</p>
