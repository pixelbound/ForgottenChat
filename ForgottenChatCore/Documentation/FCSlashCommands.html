  <hr />
</div>
<p align="justify">There are very few Slash Commands associated with ForgottenChat, and they are all very simple.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style5">/fc<br />
</span>This command will open up and close the ForgottenChat Configuration Panel where you can modify all your FC <a href="AboutFCSettings.html">settings</a>. /forgottenchat will do this also.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style5">/fc disable <br />
</span>This command will disable most ForgottenChat capabilities at run time. It closes ALL conversation widgets, and passes whispers down to the appropriate Default WoW. Disabling ForgottenChat while it is already disabled has no effect. Consider using this in Boss Raids where CT_Raid or other mods will send numerous whispers.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style5">/fc enable <br />
</span>This command will re-enable ForgottenChat functionality after performing a /fc disable. ForgottenChat is automatically enabled upon login regardless of its state prior to the last shutdown. Enabling ForgottenChat has no effect if already enabled.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style5">/fc log <br />
</span>This command will open up a general history of all whispers that you have received, in the order that you received them. The ForgottenChat log frame is NOT resizeable.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style5">/fc &lt;name&gt; <br />
</span>By replacing &lt;name&gt; with a character's name in game, it will open a new widget for that person. (EG. /fc Amonette). If there has been conversation with this person since you first logged on, the personal chat history will be placed in the widget. The command is not case sensitive. If you create a window in this manner and there is nobody on the server with the given name, Shit Will Happen. </p>
